    <h1>Tomato Soup</h1>
    <p>My grandma's favourite soup! She always uses her homemade tomato sauce which is so thick
    that it is hard to stir. Of course, nothing can beat that, but I found a brand which reaches at least
    a similar level. It is the Lidl shop's own Italian style brand called Italiamo. I would
        definitely recommend that sauce for this soup.</p>

    <h3>What I used:</h3>

        <li>2 ts olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small red onion</li>
        <li>1 bottle of Italiamo tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 gloves of garlic</li>
        <li>salt, pepper</li>
        <li>water</li>
    </ul>
