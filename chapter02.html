    <h1>Gulyás Soup (Goulash)</h1>
    <p>I visited many countries and I noticed (especially in the western and northern parts of Europe)
        that when I ordered ‘gulyás’ (“Goulash”) in a restaurant, I got a stew. Originally, ‘gulyás’ is
        a traditional Hungarian soup, you can find it in every single traditional restaurant in Hungary
        or in big festivals. The name ‘gulyás’ means “herdsman”, however, he watches over only a herd of
        cows (not sheep, etc.) as in Hungarian there is a different word for a herdsman who watches over
        e.g. a herd of sheep or horses. The meaning is very important in this case, because the main ingredient
        of this soup is beef –surprise, surprise - because of the herdsman. The herdsman basically lived his
        life on the fields, the original ‘gulyás’ is made outside on open fire in a big cauldron called ‘bogrács’.
