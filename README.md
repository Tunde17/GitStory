# GitStory

Git Story for Web Software Engineering module with three HTML files
including three chapters of a story.

Demonstrated push/pull requests, commits, issues, branches, tags and .gitignore file was added as well.

Created an index (home) page which links to the three chapters.
An alternative version of chapter 3 was created by adding 'alternativeEndingOfChapter3' branch.

The GitStory is published on GitHub pages: https://tunde17.github.io/
