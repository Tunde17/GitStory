    <h1>Butternut Squash Soup</h1>
    <p>I love cooking, but I’m very picky at the same time, therefore whenever I find a great recipe,
        I always change it to my taste. That’s exactly what I did with an amazing butternut squash soup
        recipe I found the other day. I checked at least twenty others and put together the finest
        ingredients as I like them. So here it goes!</p>
    <h3>What I used:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium butternut squash</li>
        <li>4 carrots</li>
        <li>3 baby potatoes</li>
        <li>1 medium red onion</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>fresh thyme and rosemary</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>2 litres of vegetable stock</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Peel and cut all the veggies (squash, carrots, onion, garlic) into large cubes, add some
        olive oil, thyme and rosemary and put them into the oven for 40 minutes (180 C). When time is up,
        put some olive oil into a pan, add the vegetables from the oven and 2 litres of vegetable stock.
        Cook it on very low heat for 15-20 minutes. After that pour the soup into a blender and pulse it
        until smooth. Put the soup back to the pan, gently reheat and season to taste. </p>
    <p>You can serve it with croutons, or with some pumpkin seed on top. If you are a meat lover,
        I would recommend to add bacon on top.</p>
